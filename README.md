Alexa Transit Times Skill
=========================

This is an Alexa skill for getting public transit information such as next bus and train times for your common trips such as your commute.

Examples:

	Alexa, open public transit.

	(You have no trips. Add a trip by...)

	Add a trip named zoo.

	(What is the starting address?)

	25 Massachusetts Ave Northwest, Washington, DC

	(What is the ending address?)

	3001 Connecticut Ave Northwest, Washington, DC

	(I added your trip.)

	Check times to zoo.

	(At Union Station, a Red Line arrives in 5 minutes...)
