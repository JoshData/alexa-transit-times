> Alexa, open public transit.

> *You have 1 trip stored. You can get next transit times by saying get times to "work." To add a trip, say "add a trip named work" or give it another name. You can also list trips or get more information about your saved trips. Say stop or cancel to exit this skill.*
>
> List trips.
>
> *You have 1 trip: "work." Say "tell me about work" for more information. Or "remove trip named work" to remove it.*
>
